# Committees Meetings -> Guests 

We want to create a list of the guests attending the Knesset's committees.  
Work plan:  
 1. Get committees protocols  
   - use OpenKnesset data
   - automate this
   - files are in txt format
2. From each committee protocol extract relevant information
    - guest list
        - person
        - position 
    - committee info
        - meeting title
        - date
        - etc...

3. Save all to CommitteesGuests database
